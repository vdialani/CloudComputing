 This project demonstrates the use of Restful JAX-RS.
To build the project use:
	mvn clean package
To run the project with the built in jetty server run the command
	mvn jetty:run
check the non-queue version of the application by visiting the page
	http://localhost:8080/queue/myapp/customers/all
	http://localhost:8080/queue/myapp/customers/find?phone=<phone number>, for example
	http://localhost:8080/queue/myapp/customers/find?phone=503-555-7555

To check the queue based version of the service, visit the following URLs
	http://localhost:8080/queue/enterprise/customers/all
	http://localhost:8080/queue/enterprise/customers/find?phone=<phone number>, for example
	http://localhost:8080/queue/enterprise/customers/find?phone=503-555-7555

Simulate a huge workload
	for ((i=1;i<=10000;i++)); do   curl -v --header "Connection: keep-alive" "http://localhost:8080/queue/enterprise/customers/find?phone=503-555-7555"; done &
